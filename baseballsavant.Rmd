The Baseball Savant site (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com) provides detailed pitch-by-pitch data directly from Major League Baseball.  This data is generated using a suite of instruments installed in every major league stadium.  Gathering data for research use can be done using the search function (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search).  The amount of data that can be retrieved in a single query is limited, so the retrieval of an entire season can be done by querying for each team individually and then selecting the "download CSV" option.  The _sv_id_ column in the data gives an encoded date and time for each pitch.  For example, an _sv_id_ of `181001_195541` refers to a pitch that occured on October 1, 2018 at 19:55:41.  The data does not distinguish whether that refers to local time, eastern time, or UTC time.  To determine the value, we examined all Savant records in which _sv_id_ was populated and the _pitch_number_ and _at_bat_number_ were both 1.  This indicated the time of the first pitch of each game.  Using Baseball Reference (https://baseball-reference.com) we can find the start time of each game and compare to the time portion of _sv_id_.  The April 10, 2018 game between the Cubs and Pirates at Wrigley Field had a published start time of 1:20 PM Central (2:20 PM Eastern).  The _sv_id_ for the first pitch was `180410_182326` indicating that the first pitch was at 6:23 PM.  Chicago is 5 hours behind UTC time, so 1:23 PM in Chicago corresponds with 6:23 PM UTC.  This shows that the time portion of the _sv_id_ field is listed as UTC time.
