# Bibliography

#### ( https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/common_writing_assignments/annotated_bibliographies/index.html )
The writer includes three paragraphs: a summary, an evaluation of the text, and a reflection on its applicability to his/her own research, respectively.


### Cross, Rod. *Physics of Baseball & Softball*. Springer, 2011.
    This book mainly focuses on the physics involved in the sport of baseball. Simple math is used to model various physical aspects of the game. The effects of weather, altitude, temperature, humidity, and wind are briefly discussed, but are not the focus of the work.

### Bahill, A. Terry. *The Science of Baseball*. 2nd ed. Springer, 2019.
    The science and physics behind how many aspects of baseball work are discussed in this book. It is very mathematically focused. Weather conditions, such as temperature, are brought up frequently, but are only the focus of one or two chapters of the book. Weather conditions, such as air pressure, temperature, and humidity, as well as modeling philosophies, are discussed.
    
    There are a few sections in this book that could greatly help with   our research.

### Constancio, Chris. “Temperature Effects.” *The Hardball Times*, 23 Oct. 2006, https://tht.fangraphs.com/temperature-effects/. Accessed 3 April 2019.
    This article does not present any data but offers some observations that may be worth examining while using data.  First, the author suggests that in cold weather, pitchers that rely on breaking balls are at a disadvantage vs. hard-throwing pitchers.  It also suggests that patient hitting teams also fare better during cold weather than free-swinging teams.  Each of these two anecdotal assertions could be examined more closely using weather data.

### Schifman, Gerald. “Cold Weather, Positions and Penalties.” *The Hardball Times*, 7 Jan 2016, https://tht.fangraphs.com/cold-weather-positions-and-penalties/. Accessed 3 April 2019.
    This paper examines how the hitting performance of players is affected across the temperature spectrum.  The authors limit their study to night games and use game-time temperature only.  In certain cases, they use wind-chill instead of standard temperature.  The findings indicate that players associated with positions that see frequent action are less affected by colder weather.  Additionally, they found that the DH penalty appears to disappear when it is very cold.

### Zimmerman, Jeff. “Quick Study: Cold-Weather Effects on Velocity.” *FanGraphs*, 12 April 2016, https://blogs.fangraphs.com/instagraphs/quick-study-cold-weather-effects-on-velocity/. Accessed 3 April 2019.
    The author runs a daily velocity report that measures the pitching velocity of MLB pitchers to determine if any have shown major changes to their pitching velocity.  After a game played in particularly cold weather, the author noticed that both starting pitchers exhibited large drops in velocity.  The author looked at data from 2008-2015 and determined that in games played below 40 degrees (Farenheit), pitchers lost around 0.5 mph in velocity.

    This analysis used the PITCHf/x data from MLB to compare the average velocity for each pitcher in games that began at less than 40 degrees with the average velocity in games that began above 40 degrees.  This was a useful analysis, but not too rigorous.

    This data and analysis provides some confirmation for the expectation that weather affects the velocity of the pitch.

### Kagan, David, and Mitchell, Chris. "The Effect of the Marine Layer on Fly Balls." *The Hardball Times Baseball Annual*, 2017, https://physics.csuchico.edu/baseball/Pubs/MarineLayer.pdf. Accessed 3 April 2019.
    The marine layer is a phenomenon that occurs on the west coast of the US.  Cool, moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves inland and gets trapped under the warmer air.  This typically occurs in evenings in June and July.  The lower temperature is expected to reduce the distance that a ball travels, but the higher humidity is expected to increase the distance it travels.

    The authors examined day vs. night fly ball distances at west coast ballparks.  This did not convincingly demonstrate a difference.  They also examined day vs. night and home vs. away distances for individual players, again showing no conclusive evidence.  The authors then turned to Weather Underground data and tried to specify parameters which would indicated when the marine layer was in effect.  The data that they found was available only from airports and thus farther from the ballpark in some cities than in others.  When creating a regression model using this weather data, they found that the P-value was below 0.10 for the two ballparks that were closest to airports (indicating that the weather data was most accurate).  Both of these parks showed that when the marine layer was present, fly balls traveled around 6 fewer feet.  The authors suggest that the marine layer exists but is relatively minor and not worth the mythological status that some hitters attach to it.
