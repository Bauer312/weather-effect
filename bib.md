    The author runs a daily velocity report that measures the pitching velocity of MLB pitchers to determine if any have shown major changes to their pitching velocity.  After a game played in particularly cold weather, the author noticed that both starting pitchers exhibited large drops in velocity.  The author looked at data from 2008-2015 and determined that in games played below 40 degrees (Farenheit), pitchers lost around 0.5 mph in velocity.

    This analysis used the PITCHf/x data from MLB to compare the average velocity for each pitcher in games that began at less than 40 degrees with the average velocity in games that began above 40 degrees.  This was a useful analysis, but not too rigorous.

    This data and analysis provides some confirmation for the expectation that weather affects the velocity of the pitch.
