Baseball is a sport traditionally played outdoors. With a long season, the players inevitably face a wide variety of weather.  Players have passed down tales of home runs that fall short due to temperature [@kagan2017mlfb] and scientists have studied the variations in laboratory settings [@cross2011pbs, pp 43-44] [@bahill2019sb, pp 180-188].  We know now that air density affects the flight of the ball and that temperature, humidity and air pressure all play a role in increasing or decreasing the air density.  Using air density, we can model baseball flight using formulas that have been derived for that purpose.

The differing weather that players face should cause performance to vary, and indeed analysis of available baseball data has shown that observed differences in the flight of the ball can be correlated with measured weather data [@kagan2017mlfb].  This analysis has shown that the quality of the weather data is important for demonstrating the statistical significance of these differences.  Weather data has typically been available from airports that are near the baseball stadiums, and when the airports are closer, the results of the analysis is of higher quality [@kagan2017mlfb, pg 6].  Unfortunately, few baseball stadiums are very close to commercial airports.  The quality of the weather data used thus far is much worse than the quality of the baseball data.

In addition to the effect of weather on a baseball in flight, the human body is affected by the weather.  Analysis has shown that temperature affects players differently based on how active they are during the time that their team is on defense [@schifman2016cwpp].  Intuitively, this make sense; players that must be active on defense are building up body heat and are keeping their muscles loose.  Interestingly as well, pitchers report that it is harder to grip the ball when it is cold [@constancio2006te, pg 2].

Previous analysis has relied upon weather data that in many cases is not ideal.  We have found ways to identify weather data from weather stations that are closer to baseball stadiums.  It has not been possible to access all of this data, but in the cases in which it was possible, this data allows us to better understand the correlations between weather and performance.  We are also able to generate a model that predicts the performance/distance of a batted ball as if it were to have happened in another stadium at any specific time (assuming we have weather data for that time).
