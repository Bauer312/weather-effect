Baseball is a sport traditionally played outdoors and with a long season, players inevitably face a wide variety of weather.  Players have passed down tales of home runs that fall short due to temperature [@kagan2017mlfb] and scientists have studied the variations in laboratory settings [@cross2011pbs, pp 43-44] [@bahill2019sb, pp 180-188].  We know now that air density affects the flight of the ball and that temperature, humidity and air pressure all play a role in increasing or decreasing the air density.  Using air density, we can model baseball flight using formulas that have been derived for that purpose.

The differing weather that players face should cause performance to vary, and indeed analysis of available baseball data has shown that observed differences in the flight of the ball can be correlated with measured weather data [@kagan2017mlfb].  This analysis has shown that the quality of the weather data is important for demonstrating the statistical significance of these differences.  Weather data has typically been available from airports that are near the baseball stadiums, and when the airports are closer, the results of the analysis is of higher quality [@kagan2017mlfb, pg 6].  Unfortunately, few baseball stadiums are very close to commercial airports.  The quality of the weather data used thus far is much worse than the quality of the baseball data.

In addition to the effect of weather on a baseball in flight, the human body is affected by the weather.  Analysis has shown that temperature affects players differently based on how active they are during the time that their team is on defense [@schifman2016cwpp].  Intuitively, this make sense; players that must be active on defense are building up body heat and are keeping their muscles loose.  Interestingly as well, pitchers report that it is harder to grip the ball when it is cold [@constancio2006te, pg 2].

We have found ways to identify and access weather data from weather stations that are closer to baseball stadiums.  The availablity of this data should result in much better data quality and will allow us to better model the differences in ball trajectories based on weather.  It will allow us to quantify how much of the difference in flight is from the air density and how much is from the player.  This will allow us to generate a model that predicts the performance/distance of a batted ball if it were to have happened in another stadium at any specific time (assuming we have weather data for that time).

The path of each hit will be transfered from one stadium to another through the use of the unique variables of air density, gravitational acceleration due to elevation, as well as the wind speed and direction at the time of the pitch.  The change in change in the distance the ball would travel will be what is primarily what will be looked at however, the change in the height the ball reaches as well as if it is pushed horizonally could also be explored.  By exmaining this there is the potential to find advantages weather conditions for a batter.  Examining how a pitcher pitches are affected by the weather may also be looked at using the same variables.
