What it means
  We can conclude from this analysis that the warmer the temperature and higher the relative humidity, the farther the ball will travel.  Inversely a higher the barometric pressure causes a decrease in batted ball distance.  From this it is difficult to say who will have a bigger advantage from greater ball movement.  It is likely that the pitcher would receive an initial edge as a pitch with greater movement is more difficult to hit.  For a batter, the weather conditions could affect whether a batted ball is a single or a home run potentially having a large impact on the result of the game.  However, since hitting is a reaction to the pitch it may not be practical to say that the result would be a direct translation to different weather conditions as the inciting incident would also be changed.

Limitations
  The limitations we faced from this project were primarily from the ability to gather precise and accurate data.  The weather data in particular was limited due to the data collection sites not being at the ball parks being examined.  This location difference causes a difference between the actual weather and the collected weather data creating a built in error for our analysis that would vary based on the stability of the weather conditions at the time of analyzed baseball event.  Some weather conditions like temperature and air density may not be vastly different but, others like the speed and direction of wind gusts could have a bit more variance depending on the distance from the stadium the collection site is.  More accurate weather data from the site of analysis would certainly yield more accurate results.

Future work to perform
  We examined primarily how the ball is affected by the weather but, a similar analysis could be done on how the weather affects the performance of the players.  The human body exerts different amounts of energy and perspiration based on the weather conditions around it.  A team may be able to better position their players or be able to predict how quickly a player will start to loose their effectiveness over the course of a game by looking at how a players speed and defensive range change with the conditions the player is facing in the game.  This type of analysis may be be more helpful for pitchers as the defensive involvement from a position player will vary from game to game.
