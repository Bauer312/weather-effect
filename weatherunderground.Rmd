Weather Underground is a site (https://www.wunderground.com) that contains data for a number of "official" weather stations as well as ~250,000 personal weather stations from around the globe.  Each weather station has a unique identifying code in the Weather Underground system.  For example, weather station KMABROOK5 is at the corner of Beacon and Carlton St just a few blocks west of Fenway Park.  Weather station KMABOSTO55 is listed as at Fenway Park itself, but unfortunately attempts to query the Weather Underground API for data from this station was unsuccessful.  When viewing the dashboard for a weather station (https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/KMABROOK5), all data for that weather station for a particular day is loaded.  By looking at the format of the request made by the web browser, we can see how to query any weather station for any day.  The data is returned as a set of observations in the JSON format.  We have developed a tool that "flattens" these observations into a CSV format suitable for use in R.  An example of the raw observation data provided by Weather Underground is shown below:

Each weather station reports data to Weather Underground periodically.  However, each weather station is different in frequency and time between observations.  For many of the weather variables, the observation contains the minimum, maximum and average value of that variable over the time period since the prior observation.  For this reason, we have to use the average value of that variable as our data point for the range of time between observations.  The barometric pressure readings, on the other hand, only show a high and low value as well as the trend, but the trend is frequently empty.  We have decided to average the high and low values and use that.

Unfortunately, the barometric pressure is further complicated by the fact that there are multiple ways to report pressure (true pressure as observed at the station, sea level corrected pressure, or sea level corrected pressure with past readings factored in) and each station reports in one of those ways without specifying which it is reporting [@choosepws2012].  The National Weather Service reports sea level corrected pressure at airports.  By comparing the weather station value with the nearby airport value for observations at the same time, we can make an educated guess about the reporting method used by the weather station.  As the elevation of a weather station increases, the pressure decreases - about 1.1 inHG per 1000 feet [@choosepws2012].  If the simultaneous pressure reading of the weather station and the airport differs be a few hundredths (inHg), then the weather station is highly likely to be reporting the sea level corrected pressure rather than the true pressure.
