MLB also makes data available to its GameDay application using a hierarchical website (http://gd2.mlb.com/content/game/mlb) containing many XML files.  For any particular game, there is a file titled _inning_all.xml_ that contains a sequential list of all at bats during the game.  The structure of the XML file allows us to determine the at bat number and the pitch number within the at bat.  Each pitch object in the file contains an _sv_id_ and a _start_tfs_zulu_ attribute.  This allowed us to construct a parallel timeline for each baseball game and to join it to the Baseball Savant data.  While the _sv_id_ and _start_tfs_zulu_ attributes were not 100% populated, once joined with the Baseball Savant data we had an accurate date and time for more than 99% of all pitches in the 2018 baseball season.
