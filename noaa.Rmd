The National Weather Service provides weather data primarily from commercial airports and military bases.  Data for each weather station is contained in a single file for each year.  The longitude and latitude of the station is provided and we built a process identify the distance to the nearest baseball stadium.  An example is shown for a few stadiums.  The file name, the station name, and the distance to the stadium in miles is provided:

The file contains many types of climate reports for a particular weather station.  We found that the FM-15 report type (METAR Aviation routine weather report) contained all needed information, including station elevation, wind speed and direction, temperature, sea level corrected air pressure and dew point (we can determine humidity with these variables).  Each individual measurement includes a quality code:

```
0 = Passed gross limits check
1 = Passed all quality control checks
2 = Suspect
3 = Erroneous
4 = Passed gross limits check, data originate from an NCEI data source
5 = Passed all quality control checks, data originate from an NCEI data source
6 = Suspect, data originate from an NCEI data source
7 = Erroneous, data originate from an NCEI data source
9 = Passed gross limits check if element is present
