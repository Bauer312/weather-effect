* Week 11 - (April 15 - 19) Peer Review of First Draft of Project Introduction and Methods
* Week 12 - (April 22 - 26) Finalizing Course Project
* Week 13 - (April 29 - May 3) Finalizing Course Project

## Grading Breakdown
The research project is 40% of the final grade - 30% paper and 10% presentation.

## Potential Subjects
* Use hour-by-hour weather data to adjust every at-bat; use that data to build a weather-independent ballpark factor, which will be used in openWAR calculations.  The openWAR method will be amended to include a weather adjustment to each at-bat.
* Create a model that will show how a pitch and/or a batted ball would have traveled had it been in any other stadium.
* Analyze player performance based on weather conditions.

## Challenges
Finding useful weather data from weather stations that are near baseball stadiums may prove to be very difficult.
