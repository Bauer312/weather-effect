# Data

## MLB Baseball Savant

The Baseball Savant site (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com) provides detailed pitch-by-pitch data directly from Major League Baseball.  This data is generated using a suite of instruments installed in every major league stadium.  Gathering data for research use can be done using the search function (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search).  The amount of data that can be retrieved in a single query is limited, so the retrieval of an entire season can be done by querying for each team individually and then selecting the "download CSV" option.  The _sv_id_ column in the data gives an encoded date and time for each pitch.

### Weather Underground

Weather Underground is a site (https://www.wunderground.com) that contains data for a number of "official" weather stations as well as ~250,000 personal weather stations from around the globe.  Each weather station has a unique identifying code in the Weather Underground system.  For example, weather station KMABROOK5 is at the corner of Beacon and Carlton St just a few blocks west of Fenway Park.  Weather station KMABOSTO55 is listed as at Fenway Park itself, but unfortunately attempts to query the Weather Underground API for data from this station was unsuccessful.  When viewing the dashboard for a weather station (https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/KMABROOK5), all data for that weather station for a particular day is loaded.  By looking at the format of the request made by the web browser, we can see how to query any weather station for any day.  The data is returned as a set of observations in the JSON format.  We have developed a tool that "flattens" these observations into a CSV format suitable for use in R.

Each weather station reports data to Weather Underground periodically.  However, each weather station is different in frequency and time between observations.  For many of the weather variables, the observation contains the minimum, maximum and average value of that variable over the time period since the prior observation.  For this reason, we have to use the average value of that variable as our data point for the range of time between observations.  The barometric pressure readings, on the other hand, only show a high and low value as well as the trend, but the trend is frequently empty.  We have decided to average the high and low values and use that.  Unfortunately, the barometric pressure is further complicated by the fact that there are multiple ways to report pressure (true pressure as observed at the station, sea level-corrected pressuere, or sea level-corrected pressure with past readings factored in) and each station reports in one of those ways without specifying which it is reporting.  The National Weather Service reports sea level-corrected pressure at airports, so we can compare the weather station value with the nearby airport value.  If the two values have a large and consistant difference between the two over time, we can reasonably guess that the station is reporting the true pressure and if not, assume that it is the sea level-corrected value.

The formula for calculating air density is described in @bahill2019sb180 and is an input to the ball trajectory code.  The three inputs to the calculation are the temperature, the humidity level, and the true station pressure (if provided with sea level-corrected pressure, it must be adjusted to true station pressure).
