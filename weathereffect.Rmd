abstract: "Weather has long been known to affect the flight of the baseball.  Scientific effort has given us the ability to calculate flight trajectories in a laboratory setting.  Previous analysis has been done with real-world baseball and weather data, but has been hampered by the lack of good weather data.  We use very accurate baseball data and much more accurate weather data to build a model that predicts the flight of a batted ball as if it had been hit in a different stadium or at a different time."
